# LabShark
This is the repository that will be used to create the final software product

There will be directories for each subsystem, and two to integrate the entire project: one is the final, approved, working, version of the system, 
and the other a testing(unofficial version of the system) to help with integration. 


Rules for Labshark Repo
*****NOTE**************
* Do not push anything into the official version, only comitte members can push into the official directory, but it can not be pushed 
  with out the other comittee members consent and the program has been tested thoroughly and has been properly integrated in the
  unofficial version
* The subsytem directories can be pushed without comitte consent. 
* Members can pull the unofficial version and work on integration, but if a member feels that a verion of his program is good enough
 to be integrated into the unofficial version, said member must notify the lead programmer and the lead programmer will approve of either 
 the members request to push into the unofficial version.
* Members can only modify their assigned directories and can not mess with anyone elses repos.
* Only the lead programmer can modify someones elses subdirectory when a member needs help or is collaborating with that member. 
* If anyone has a concern about changing the desing of the system to solve a programming problem, please let the 
  comittee know and wait for their approval, otherwise follow the final version of the Software Design Document.
* Please keep the repositories clean of unnecesary files. 
* Members test your code thouroughly before asking to integrate, that will save you and the lead programmers time.
* Members please name your files properly for clarification and give them appropritate names. For example "poop.py" is not allowed 
        *Ideally name the files after the classes or subsystems you are trying to build. Camel Case is preffered, but not required
        Example: ProtocolDecisionTree.py, fieldBlock.py, projectState.py, etc. 
* Most importantly lets do our best and work hard so we can actually have a working system at the end of this semester.
